# Visual File System Explorer

This project involves designing and implementing algorithms to visually represent the structure of a file system on a computer. The main goal is to collect information about the file system and store it in a non-linear linked data structure, specifically a tree structure, where each node can have multiple children but at most one parent.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Displays the file system structure on different operating systems, including differences between Mac and Windows.
- **Tree Data Structure**: Implements a tree to manage file system data hierarchically.
- **Iterator Usage**: Utilizes Java's Iterator to traverse and manipulate the collection of file system data.
